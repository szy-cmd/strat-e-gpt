# Strat-e-GPT 🏁

## Predictive Race Strategy Analysis
### 🏁 Project Overview
A machine learning project designed to assist in outlining proper race strategies by providing predictive analysis of driver and race data. Our goal is to leverage historical and real-time data to forecast race outcomes and suggest optimal strategies for competitive racing.

This is a group effort, and we are developing our project using a collaborative, iterative approach.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher installed
* Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/strat-e-gpt.git
   cd strat-e-gpt
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Alternative Installation (Development)
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## ⚙️ Key Technologies & Dependencies

This project relies on the following core libraries and technologies. A full list of required Python libraries can be found in `requirements.txt`.

* **Python 3.x**: The primary programming language
* **NumPy**: Used for efficient numerical operations and handling large data arrays
* **Pandas**: The backbone of our data handling. We use it to read, clean, process, and combine multiple datasets for training and validation
* **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and data preprocessing
* **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for data exploration, visualization, and model experimentation

## 💾 Data Sources

Data is the backbone of any good prediction software. Our predictive model is trained on multiple datasets to ensure a high-quality, comprehensive set of training and validation data.

**Kaggle Datasets**: We primarily source our raw data from various racing-related datasets available on Kaggle. We will be using Pandas to configure, clean, and combine these datasets.

## 🔧 Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.data_processing import RacingDataProcessor
from src.ml_models import RaceStrategyPredictor
from src.visualization import RacingDataVisualizer

# Initialize components
data_processor = RacingDataProcessor()
ml_predictor = RaceStrategyPredictor()
visualizer = RacingDataVisualizer()

# Load and process data
data = data_processor.load_data("path/to/your/data.csv")
cleaned_data = data_processor.clean_data()

# Train models
X, y = ml_predictor.prepare_features(cleaned_data, "target_column")
results = ml_predictor.train_models(X, y)

# Visualize results
perf_fig = visualizer.plot_model_performance(results)
```

### Jupyter Notebooks
1. **Data Exploration** (`notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb`): Learn how to explore and analyze racing data
2. **ML Training** (`notebooks/02_ml_training.ipynb`): Train and evaluate machine learning models

## 📊 Features

- **Data Processing**: Automated data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- **Machine Learning**: Multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression)
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards using Plotly and Matplotlib
- **Model Management**: Save, load, and deploy trained models
- **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
