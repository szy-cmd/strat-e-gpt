Predictive Race Strategy Analysis
🏁 Project Overview
a machine learning project designed to assist in outlining proper race strategies by providing predictive analysis of driver and race data. Our goal is to leverage historical and real-time data to forecast race outcomes and suggest optimal strategies for competitive racing.

This is a group effort, and we are developing our project using a collaborative, iterative approach.

⚙️ Key Technologies & Dependencies
This project relies on the following core libraries and technologies. A full list of required Python libraries can be found in requirements.txt.

Python 3.x: The primary programming language.

NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations and handling large data arrays.

Pandas: The backbone of our data handling. We use it to read, clean, process, and combine multiple datasets for training and validation.

scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and data preprocessing.

Jupyter Notebooks: Used for data exploration, visualization, and model experimentation.

💾 Data Sources
Data is the backbone of any good prediction software. Our predictive model is trained on multiple datasets to ensure a high-quality, comprehensive set of training and validation data.

Kaggle Datasets: We primarily source our raw data from various racing-related datasets available on Kaggle. We will be using Pandas to configure, clean, and combine these datasets.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher installed.
